                                <p>All Trips, collection points and destinations must be pre-agreed through the OurLane Platform between the Chauffeur and Passenger.

                                <p>Chauffeurs and Car Owners are reminded that using the Services and accepting Car Booking offers or listing Vehicles for hire or reward or in a commercial or professional capacity through OurLane Platform is subject to additional permits and licenses from the concerned regulatory authorities and government departments.

OurLane is not and will not act as an agent for any Member.
                                </p>
                                <h4>2.3. Booking and Payment</h4>
                                <p>OurLane offers to its Members an online booking service (hereinafter, the “Booking Service”) with a view to facilitating the booking of chauffeured luxury rides by Passengers.
                                </p>
                                <p>OurLane reserves the right not to offer the Booking Service to a Trip due to: (i) changes to applicable law, or changes in the practice of regulatory authorities (ii) changes to market practices or technology changes, (iii) change of business considerations underlying the Booking Services, and (iv) other important and valid reasons
                                </p>
                                <p>Car Booking Process: The Passenger provides details of his or her Trip on the OurLane Platform, specifying the pick-up and drop-off location and then choose one of the luxury vehicles listed on the OurLane Platform. The Passenger books the chosen Vehicle for that Trip from the OurLane Platform exclusively by clicking on the button “Book” (hereinafter, the “Booking”). OurLane will then notify the Booking to the apt Chauffeurs present in and around the pick-up area. If a Chauffeur accepts the Booking then OurLane will send a confirmation notification to the Chauffeur and the Passenger confirming the Booking (hereinafter, the “Booking Confirmation”). Once a Booking Confirmation has been sent, the Booking is complete and a separate binding agreement for Car Booking relating to the Trip shall be formed between the Chauffeur and Passenger(s).</p>
                                <p>Members accept that given the nature of the service Chauffeurs and Passengers will have no recourse to OurLane for any aspect of the transaction including in relation to the cancellation or last-minute changes to the Trip, failure by the Chauffeur or the Passenger to turn up or non-payment of the Payment. In particular, it is the Chauffeur’s responsibility to collect payment from the Passenger at the time of the Trip.</p>
                                <p>OurLane is not obliged to contact either party and will take no other steps whatsoever than those described above to manage the Booking. The operation of the Trip is solely managed by the respective Chauffeur and Passenger(s).
                                    Please note that OurLane reserves the right to change any aspect of the OurLane Platform or the Service which may include adding new services (which may require payment) or withdrawing any existing Services. OurLane does not guarantee that the OurLane Platform will be functional at all times and Services may be suspended during such period when the OurLane Platform is not in operation. OurLane will not be liable to any of the Members in the case where the OurLane Platform is non-operational.
                                    </p>

                                        <li>The Chauffeur must comply with the Conduct Guidelines at all times.

                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
